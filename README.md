# Emotion-Aware Response Ranking System

## ðŸ§  Overview

This project introduces an advanced response ranking mechanism for emotionally sensitive conversational AI systems. The architecture integrates **emotion intensity scoring** and **contextual relevance** via a weighted formula to generate **empathetic and context-aware responses**.

The system aims to:
- **Enhance empathetic dialogue** using emotional intensity and classification.
- **Optimize response selection** by balancing factual relevance and emotional alignment.
- **Track emotional change** in users over time, supporting mental health and emotional growth.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Emotion Intensity Scoring** using NRC Emotion Intensity Lexicon.
- **Emotion Categorization** based on Plutchikâ€™s 8 primary emotions.
- **Response Generation** via fine-tuned `google/gemma-1.3b-it` with GRPO and RAG.
- **Dynamic Response Ranking** using a tunable `Î±` parameter.
- **Privacy-First Architecture** (no raw message storage).

## ðŸ“Š Response Ranking Formula

Each user message generates **five response candidates**. These are scored using:

FinalScore[i] = (1 - Î±) Ã— RAGscore[i] + Î± Ã— Intensityscore[i]


- `RAGscore[i]`: Relevance score via Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- `Intensityscore[i]`: Emotional depth score using NRC-based scoring
- `Î±`: A value between `0` and `1` to balance factual vs emotional preference

**Tuning Î±:**
- `Î± â‰ˆ 0`: Prioritize factual accuracy
- `Î± â‰ˆ 1`: Prioritize emotional alignment

This formula allows adaptive prioritization depending on the conversation context (e.g., mental health support vs informative QA).

## ðŸ”„ Workflow

1. **User Input**  
   â†’ Sent to Emotion Intensity Scorer + Emotion Classifier + RAG Retriever

2. **Candidate Generation**  
   â†’ Fine-tuned Gemma model (`gemma-1.3b-it`) generates 5 responses via GRPO

3. **Scoring & Ranking**  
   â†’ Each response is scored by:
   - Emotional intensity scorer (BERT + NRC)
   - RAG relevance system

4. **Best Response Selection**  
   â†’ FinalScore is calculated for each response  
   â†’ Top-scoring response is selected
